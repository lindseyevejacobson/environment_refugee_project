<div id="about-content" class="content-block">
  <h3>By 2020, 50 million people will be displaced because of a drastic change in their environment. ClimateMigrants.com is building a movement to track and assist these people. We believe that with preparation and organization, Climate Migration can become an opportunity for cross cultural exploration and problem solving, alongside of disaster relief.

ClimateMigrants.com scours the internet for visual and personal stories of climate migrants. Our first step is to track and catalogue all of the existing research. Next, we will start generating new stories and filling in the current holes in the research.

  <h3> ClimateMigrants.com seeks to help define the role of Climate migration within the larger conversation about Refugees, International Displacement, and Economic Migrants. While these categories are helpful, they are not all inclusive. We need to open the conversation up to include people affected by natural disasters and Climate Change within their country of origin and outside of it. To share your story or get involved, contact <%= mail_to "lindseyevejacobson@gmail.com" %>.</h3>
